2) uNode - plugin that allows designers, artists and programmers to create gameplay mechanics, interactive systems and even C# script without writing a single line of code.
3) Dynamic pathfinding system 
4) DI - for in-game depandencies(can work as service locator)
5) Chunk master -  to save the playing field during the game and load units and buildings in the future
6) SuperCombine 
7) AdMob
8) Yandex metrix
9) DoTween 
10) FireBase  


### 2. Geometry! Smash
1) Work with shaders
2) Admob, Facebokk SDK, Firebase crashlytics, integration
